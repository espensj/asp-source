# No Naughty Fingers, No Weird Websites

##
Once there was a
butterfly named Fiffie.
She was clever at
working with
computers.

##
Fiffie saw a girl who was
upset and sad.
The girl saw a nasty
picture on a website.

##
Fiffie flew over to the
girl's house.

##
She said to the girl,
“Never go on the
internet without a
grownup.”

##
The girl and Fiffie
became friends.
Fiffie went to live with
the girl.

##
When the girl grew up
she opened her own
computer shop.
Every week she had
lessons to teach
children how to work on
computers.

##
She taught the children
never to go on websites
without the permission
of grownups.
Because of Fiffie, the
woman never had
naughty fingers again!
