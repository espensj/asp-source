# Oscar the Shark

##
Oscar has a problem
with his eyes.
He cannot see any fish.

##
But he will not eat his
carrots.

##
Johnnie the seahorse
says, “Oscar, eat your
carrots!”

##
But Oscar does not like
the taste of carrots.

##
“Carrots will help you to
see better,” says
Johnnie.

##
Oscar goes to the
doctor.
Oscar and Johnnie wait
for Dr Shakes.

##
Dr Shakes says,
“Glasses will help you
to see better.”

##
Oscar does not want to
wear glasses.

##
But the glasses help
Oscar see the fishes.
Now he eats his carrots
with fish!
